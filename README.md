## Hello! 
### My name is Kassie Jensen.
##### This is my *github repository* for MBIO612. This repository will hold:
* folders for each week with:
  * data
  * output
  * scripts
    
###### I study __bryophytes__ (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), so here is a photo of my favorite moss called *Entosthodon subintegrus*.
