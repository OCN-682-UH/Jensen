##Hello! 
###My name is Kassie Jensen
#####This is my github repository for MBIO612. This repository will hold folders for exercises and homework each week. 

#####I study _bryophytes_ (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts). Here is a photo of one of my favorite bryophytes: ![*Pyrrhobryum spiniforme*](https://github.com/OCN-682-UH/Jensen/blob/3e0ddc849c452862ddb6c5ece3cd5ace56d5ec57/Photos/IMG_4933.HEIC), aka _fire-moss_
