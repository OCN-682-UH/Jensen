## Hello! 
### My name is Kassie Jensen.
###### I study _bryophytes_ (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts). My favorite moss is called *Entosthodon subintegrus*. ![moss pic](https://flickr.com/photos/mileskt/51283715472/in/album-72157719021897001). 

##### This is my *github repository* for MBIO612. This repository will hold:
* folders for each week with:
 * data
 * output
 * scripts

##### I'm looking forward to seeing what we will learn!
