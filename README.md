## Hello! 
### My name is Kassie Jensen.
##### This is my *github repository* for MBIO612. This repository will hold folders for exercises and homework each week. 

##### I study _bryophytes_ (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts). My favorite moss is called *Entosthodon subintegrus*. ![moss pic](https://flickr.com/photos/mileskt/51283715472/in/album-72157719021897001).
