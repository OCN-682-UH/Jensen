## Hello! 
### My name is Kassie Jensen.
##### This is my *github repository* for MBIO612. This repository will hold:
* folders for each week with:
  * data
  * output
  * scripts
    
###### I study _bryophytes_ (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts). My favorite moss is called *Entosthodon subintegrus*.<img width="681" alt="ENTSUB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d507dfce-e582-4fd0-be6e-423c3684c1e1"> 

##### I'm looking forward to seeing what we will learn!
